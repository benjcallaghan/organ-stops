# What is Organ Stops?

Pipe organs have long been a traditional part of religious hymns and other songs due to their ability to control an entire orchestra from a set of piano-like keyboards. Each instrument of this orchestra can be turned on or off through a series of buttons or plungers known collectively as stops. The number of stops on even a simple organ can easily intimidate a new player. The organist knows that there are many possible combinations, but only a select few will do the song justice. Organ Stops was created as a way for organists to view and share the registrations they use for a variety of hymns. Anyone can simply look up the hymn they want to play and see a full listing of organ stops that should be used. Users who create a free account can also add their own registrations to share with others. Now every organist can play like a professional.
