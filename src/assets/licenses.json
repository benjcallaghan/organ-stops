Please see the [Ionic Native documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/) for complete instructions on how to add and use the plugins.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor the full Ionic Native documentation, please visit [https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/).\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nTo use a plugin, import and add the plugin provider to your `@NgModule`, and then inject it where you wish to use it.\n\n```typescript\n// app.module.ts\nimport { Camera } from '@ionic-native/camera';\n\n...\n\n@NgModule({\n  ...\n\n  providers: [\n    ...\n    Camera\n    ...\n  ]\n  ...\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n```\n\n```typescript\nimport { Geolocation } from '@ionic-native/geolocation';\nimport { Platform } from 'ionic-angular';\n\nimport { NgZone } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({ ... })\nexport class MyComponent {\n\n  constructor(private geolocation: Geolocation, private platform: Platform, private ngZone: NgZone) {\n\n    platform.ready().then(() => {\n\n      // get position\n      geolocation.getCurrentPosition().then(pos => {\n\n        console.log(`lat: ${pos.coords.latitude}, lon: ${pos.coords.longitude}`)\n\n      });\n\n\n      // watch position\n      const watch = geolocation.watchPosition().subscribe(pos => {\n\n        console.log(`lat: ${pos.coords.latitude}, lon: ${pos.coords.longitude}`)\n\n        // Currently, observables from Ionic Native plugins\n        // need to run inside of zone to trigger change detection\n        ngZone.run(() => {\n          this.position = pos;\n        })\n\n      });\n\n      // to stop watching\n      watch.unsubscribe();\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n}\n```\n\n### Mocking and Browser Development\n\nIonic Native 3.x makes it possible to mock plugins and develop nearly the entirety of your app in the browser or in `ionic serve`.\n\nTo do this, you need to provide a mock implementation of the plugins you wish to use. Here's an example of mocking the `Camera` plugin to return a stock image while in development:\n\nFirst import the `Camera` class in your `src/app/app.module.ts` file:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Camera } from '@ionic-native/camera';\n```\n\nThen create a new class that extends the `Camera` class with a mock implementation:\n\n```typescript\nclass CameraMock extends Camera {\n  getPicture(options) {\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n      resolve(\"BASE_64_ENCODED_DATA_GOES_HERE\");\n    })\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, override the previous `Camera` class in your `providers` for this module:\n\n```typescript\nproviders: [\n  { provide: Camera, useClass: CameraMock }\n]\n```\n\nHere's the full example:\n\n```typescript\nimport { NgModule, ErrorHandler } from '@angular/core';\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { IonicApp, IonicModule, IonicErrorHandler } from 'ionic-angular';\nimport { MyApp } from './app.component';\nimport { HomePage } from '../pages/home/home';\n\nimport { Camera } from '@ionic-native/camera';\n\nclass CameraMock extends Camera {\n  getPicture(options) {\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n      resolve(\"BASE_64_ENCODED_DATA_GOES_HERE\");\n    })\n  }\n}\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    MyApp,\n    HomePage\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp)\n  ],\n  bootstrap: [IonicApp],\n  entryComponents: [\n    MyApp,\n    HomePage\n  ],\n  providers: [\n    {provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: IonicErrorHandler},\n    { provide: Camera, useClass: CameraMock }\n  ]\n})\nexport class AppModule {}\n```\n\n\n### Runtime Diagnostics\n\nSpent way too long diagnosing an issue only to realize a plugin wasn't firing or installed? Ionic Native lets you know what the issue is and how you can resolve it.\n\n![img](https://ionic-io-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ionic-native-console.png)\n\n\n## Plugin Missing?\nLet us know or submit a PR! Take a look at [the Developer Guide](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md) for more on how to contribute. :heart:\n\n## Ionic v1 (AngularJS, Angular 1.x) support\n\nFor Ionic v1 (AngularJS, Angular 1.x) support, please use version 2 of Ionic Native. See the [2.x README](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/blob/v2.x/README.md) for usage information.\n\n# Credits\n\nIbby Hadeed - [@ihadeed](https://github.com/ihadeed)\n\nTim Lancina - [@timlancina](https://twitter.com/timlancina)\n\nMike Hartington - [@mhartington](https://twitter.com/mhartington)\n\nMax Lynch - [@maxlynch](https://twitter.com/maxlynch)\n\nRob Wormald - [@robwormald](https://twitter.com/robwormald)"

For more info, please see the [Facebook Connect](https://github.com/jeduan/cordova-plugin-facebook4).\n\n#### Installation\n\n To use the FB plugin, you first have to create a new Facebook App inside of the Facebook developer portal at [https://developers.facebook.com/apps](https://developers.facebook.com/apps).\n\n[![fb-getstarted-1](/img/docs/native/Facebook/1.png)](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/)\n\nRetrieve the `App ID` and `App Name`.\n\n[![fb-getstarted-2](/img/docs/native/Facebook/2.png)](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/)\n\nThen type in the following command in your Terminal, where APP_ID and APP_NAME are the values from the Facebook Developer portal.\n\n```bash\n ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-facebook4 --variable APP_ID=\"123456789\" --variable APP_NAME=\"myApplication\"\n```\n\nAfter, you'll need to add the native platforms you'll be using to your app in the Facebook Developer portal under your app's Settings:\n\n[![fb-getstarted-3](/img/docs/native/Facebook/3.png)](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/)\n\nClick `'Add Platform'`.\n\n[![fb-getstarted-4](/img/docs/native/Facebook/4.png)](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/)\n\nAt this point you'll need to open your project's [`config.xml`](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/config_ref/index.html) file, found in the root directory of your project.\n\nTake note of the `id` for the next step:\n```\n<widget id=\"com.mycompany.testapp\" version=\"0.0.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets\" xmlns:cdv=\"http://cordova.apache.org/ns/1.0\">\n```\n\nYou can also edit the `id` to whatever you'd like it to be.\n\n#### iOS Install\nUnder 'Bundle ID', add the `id` from your `config.xml` file:\n\n[![fb-getstarted-5](/img/docs/native/Facebook/5.png)](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/)\n\n\n#### Android Install\nUnder 'Google Play Package Name', add the `id` from your `config.xml` file:\n\n[![fb-getstarted-6](/img/docs/native/Facebook/6.png)](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/)\n\n\nAnd that's it! You can now make calls to Facebook using the plugin.\n\n## Events\n\nApp events allow you to understand the makeup of users engaging with your app, measure the performance of your Facebook mobile app ads, and reach specific sets of your users with Facebook mobile app ads.\n\n- [iOS] [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/app-events](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/app-events)\n- [Android] [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/app-events](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/app-events)\n- [JS] Does not have an Events API, so the plugin functions are empty and will return an automatic success\n\nActivation events are automatically tracked for you in the plugin.\n\nEvents are listed on the [insights page](https://www.facebook.com/insights/).\n\nFor tracking events, see `logEvent` and `logPurchase`.\n\n## Supported platforms\n- Android\n- iOS\n- Browser"

The CordovaError class is inherited from Error, so CordovaError instances is also valid Error instances (`instanceof` check succeeds).\n\nUsage:\n\n```js\nvar CordovaError = require('cordova-common').CordovaError;\nthrow new CordovaError('Some error message', SOME_ERR_CODE);\n```\n\nSee [CordovaError](src/CordovaError/CordovaError.js) for supported error codes.\n\n### `ConfigParser`\n\nExposes functionality to deal with cordova project `config.xml` files. For ConfigParser API reference check [ConfigParser Readme](src/ConfigParser/README.md).\n\nUsage:\n```js\nvar ConfigParser = require('cordova-common').ConfigParser;\nvar appConfig = new ConfigParser('path/to/cordova-app/config.xml');\nconsole.log(appconfig.name() + ':' + appConfig.version());\n```\n\n### `PluginInfoProvider` and `PluginInfo`\n\n`PluginInfo` is a wrapper for cordova plugins' `plugin.xml` files. This class may be instantiated directly or via `PluginInfoProvider`. The difference is that `PluginInfoProvider` caches `PluginInfo` instances based on plugin source directory.\n\nUsage:\n```js\nvar PluginInfo: require('cordova-common').PluginInfo;\nvar PluginInfoProvider: require('cordova-common').PluginInfoProvider;\n\n// The following instances are equal\nvar plugin1 = new PluginInfo('path/to/plugin_directory');\nvar plugin2 = new PluginInfoProvider().get('path/to/plugin_directory');\n\nconsole.log('The plugin ' + plugin1.id + ' has version ' + plugin1.version)\n```\n\n### `ActionStack`\n\nUtility module for dealing with sequential tasks. Provides a set of tasks that are needed to be done and reverts all tasks that are already completed if one of those tasks fail to complete. Used internally by cordova-lib and platform's plugin installation routines.\n\nUsage:\n```js\nvar ActionStack = require('cordova-common').ActionStack;\nvar stack = new ActionStack()\n\nvar action1 = stack.createAction(task1, [<task parameters>], task1_reverter, [<reverter_parameters>]);\nvar action2 = stack.createAction(task2, [<task parameters>], task2_reverter, [<reverter_parameters>]);\n\nstack.push(action1);\nstack.push(action2);\n\nstack.process()\n.then(function() {\n    // all actions succeded\n})\n.catch(function(error){\n    // One of actions failed with error\n})\n```\n\n### `superspawn`\n\nModule for spawning child processes with some advanced logic.\n\nUsage:\n```js\nvar superspawn = require('cordova-common').superspawn;\nsuperspawn.spawn('adb', ['devices'])\n.progress(function(data){\n    if (data.stderr)\n        console.error('\"adb devices\" raised an error: ' + data.stderr);\n})\n.then(function(devices){\n    // Do something...\n})\n```\n\n### `xmlHelpers`\n\nA set of utility methods for dealing with xml files.\n\nUsage:\n```js\nvar xml = require('cordova-common').xmlHelpers;\n\nvar xmlDoc1 = xml.parseElementtreeSync('some/xml/file');\nvar xmlDoc2 = xml.parseElementtreeSync('another/xml/file');\n\nxml.mergeXml(doc1, doc2); // doc2 now contains all the nodes from doc1\n```\n\n### Other APIs\n\nThe APIs listed below are also exposed but are intended to be only used internally by cordova plugin installation routines.\n\n```\nPlatformJson\nConfigChanges\nConfigKeeper\nConfigFile\nmungeUtil\n```\n\n## Setup\n* Clone this repository onto your local machine\n    `git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-lib.git`\n* In terminal, navigate to the inner cordova-common directory\n    `cd cordova-lib/cordova-common`\n* Install dependencies and npm-link\n    `npm install && npm link`\n* Navigate to cordova-lib directory and link cordova-common\n    `cd ../cordova-lib && npm link cordova-common && npm install`"

[Changelog](#10-changelog)\n\n## 1. Description\n\nThis plugin allows you to authenticate and identify users with [Google Sign-In](https://developers.google.com/identity/) on [iOS](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/) and [Android](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/).\nOut of the box, you'll get email, display name, given name, family name, profile picture url, and user id.\nYou can also configure it to get an [idToken](#7-exchanging-the-idtoken) and [serverAuthCode](#8-exchanging-the-serverauthcode).\n\nThis plugin only wraps access to the Google Sign-In API. Further API access should be implemented per use-case, per developer.\n\n## 2.

Google API setup\nTo communicate with Google you need to do some tedious setup, sorry.\n\nIt is (strongly) recommended that you use the same project for both iOS and Android.\n\n### Before you proceed\nGo into your `config.xml` and make sure that your package name (i.e. the app ID) is what you want it to be. Use this package name when setting up iOS and Android in the following steps! If you don't, you will likely get a 12501, 'user cancelled' error despite never cancelling the log in process.\n\nThis step is _especially_ important if you are using a framework such as Ionic to scaffold out your project. When you create the project, the `config.xml` has a placeholder packagename, e.g. com.ionic.*, so you can start developing right away.\n\n```xml\n<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>\n<widget id=\"** REPLACE THIS VALUE **\" ...>\n...\n</widget>\n```\n\n### iOS\nTo get your iOS `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID`, [generate a configuration file here](https://developers.google.com/mobile/add?platform=ios&cntapi=signin).\nThis `GoogleService-Info.plist` file contains the `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` you'll need during installation. _This value is only needed for iOS._\n\nThe `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` is also known as the \"iOS URL Scheme\" on the Developer's Console.\n\nLogin on iOS takes the user to a [SafariViewController](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/SafariServices/Reference/SFSafariViewController_Ref/) through the Google SDK, instead of the separate Safari browser.\n\n### Android\nTo configure Android, [generate a configuration file here](https://developers.google.com/mobile/add?platform=android&cntapi=signin). Once Google Sign-In is enabled Google will automatically create necessary credentials in Developer Console. There is no need to add the generated google-services.json file into your cordova project.\n\nMake sure you execute the `keytool` steps as explained [here](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth) or authentication will fail.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n* The step above, about `keytool`, show 2 types of certificate fingerprints, the **Release** and the **Debug**, when generating the configuration file, it's better to use the **Debug** certificate fingerprint, after that, you have to go on [Google Credentials Manager](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials), and manually create a credential for **OAuth2 client** with your **Release** certificate fingerprint. This is necessary to your application work on both Development and Production releases.\n* Ensure that you are using the correct alias name while generating the fingerprint.\n```\n$ keytool -exportcert -keystore <path-to-debug-or-production-keystore> -list -v -alias <alias-name>\n```\nLogin on Android will use the accounts signed in on the user's device.\n\n### Web Client Id\n\nIf you want to get an `idToken` or `serverAuthCode` back from the Sign In Process, you will need to pass the client ID for your project's web application. This can be found on your project's API credentials page on the [Google Developer's Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).\n\n## 4. Installation (PhoneGap CLI / Cordova CLI)\nThis plugin is compatible with:\n* [Cordova Plugman](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugman)\n* [PhoneGap 3.0 CLI](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.0.0/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-line%20Interface_add_features)\n* [Ionic](http://ionic.io/) ***(must use the Cordova CLI)***\n\nHere's how it works (backup your project first!):\n\nUsing the Cordova CLI and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-googleplus):\n```\n$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-googleplus --save --variable REVERSED_CLIENT_ID=myreversedclientid\n$ cordova prepare\n```\n\nUsing the Cordova CLI to fetch the latest version from GitHub:\n```\n$ cordova plugin add https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-googleplus --save --variable REVERSED_CLIENT_ID=myreversedclientid\n$ cordova prepare\n```\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\n* _Please note that `myreversedclientid` is a place holder for the reversed clientId you find in your iOS configuration file. Do not surround this value with quotes. **(iOS only Applications)**_\n\n* _If you are building a hybrid application **(iOS and Android)**, or an Android application, you have to replace `myreversedclientid` with the reverse value of Client ID in your **Release** credential generated on step 3, on [Google Developer's Console](https://console.developers.google.com/), this will be: **\"com.googleusercontent.apps.`uniqueId`\"**, without quotes._\n\nGooglePlus.js is brought in automatically. There is no need to change or add anything in your html.\n\n## 5. Installation (PhoneGap Build)\nAdd this to your config.xml:\n\nFor the NPM Version:\n```xml\n<gap:plugin name=\"cordova-plugin-googleplus\" source=\"npm\">\n  <param name=\"REVERSED_CLIENT_ID\" value=\"myreversedclientid\" />\n</gap:plugin>\n```\n\nFor the Git version:\n```xml\n<gap:plugin spec=\"https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-googleplus.git\" source=\"git\">\n    <param name=\"REVERSED_CLIENT_ID\" value=\"myreversedclientid\" />\n</gap:plugin>\n```\n\n## 6. Usage\nCheck the [demo app](demo) to get you going quickly, or hurt yourself and follow these steps.\n\nNote that none of these methods should be called before [`deviceready`](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/cordova/events/events.deviceready.html) has fired.\n\nExample:\n```javascript\ndocument.addEventListener('deviceready', deviceReady, false);\n\nfunction deviceReady() {\n    //I get called when everything's ready for the plugin to be called!\n    console.log('Device is ready!');\n    window.plugins.googleplus.trySilentLogin(...);\n}\n```\n\n### isAvailable\n3/31/16: This method is no longer required to be checked first. It is kept for code orthoganality.\n\n### Login\n\nThe login function walks the user through the Google Auth process. All parameters are optional, however there are a few caveats.\n\nTo get an `idToken` on Android, you ***must*** pass in your `webClientId`. On iOS, the `idToken` is included in the sign in result by default.\n\nTo get a `serverAuthCode`, you must pass in your `webClientId` _and_ set `offline` to true. If offline is true, but no webClientId is provided, the `serverAuthCode` will _**NOT**_ be requested.\n\nThe default scopes requested are `profile` and `email` (always requested). To request other scopes, add them as a **space-separated list** to the `scopes` parameter. They will be requested exactly as passed in. Refer to the [Google Scopes](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes) documentation for info on valid scopes that can be requested. For example, `'scope': 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks'`.\n\nNaturally, in order to use any additional scopes or APIs, they will need to be activated in your project Developer's Console.\n\n##### Usage\n```javascript\nwindow.plugins.googleplus.login(\n    {\n      'scopes': '... ', // optional, space-separated list of scopes, If not included or empty, defaults to `profile` and `email`.\n      'webClientId': 'client id of the web app/server side', // optional clientId of your Web application from Credentials settings of your project - On Android, this MUST be included to get an idToken. On iOS, it is not required.\n      'offline': true, // optional, but requires the webClientId - if set to true the plugin will also return a serverAuthCode, which can be used to grant offline access to a non-Google server\n    },\n    function (obj) {\n      alert(JSON.stringify(obj)); // do something useful instead of alerting\n    },\n    function (msg) {\n      alert('error: ' + msg);\n    }\n);\n```\n\nThe success callback (second argument) gets a JSON object with the following contents, with example data of my Google account:\n```javascript\n obj.email          // 'eddyverbruggen@gmail.com'\n obj.userId         // user id\n obj.displayName    // 'Eddy Verbruggen'\n obj.familyName     // 'Verbruggen'\n obj.givenName      // 'Eddy'\n obj.imageUrl       // 'http://link-to-my-profilepic.google.com'\n obj.idToken        // idToken that can be exchanged to verify user identity.\n obj.serverAuthCode // Auth code that can be exchanged for an access token and refresh token for offline access\n```\n\nAdditional user information is available by use case. Add the scopes needed to the scopes option then return the info to the result object being created in the `handleSignInResult` and `didSignInForUser` functions on Android and iOS, respectively.\n\nOn Android, the error callback (third argument) receives an error status code if authentication was not successful. A description of those status codes can be found on Google's android developer website at [GoogleSignInStatusCodes](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/auth/api/signin/GoogleSignInStatusCodes).\n\nOn iOS, the error callback will include an [NSError localizedDescription](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSError_Class/).\n\n### Try silent login\nYou can call `trySilentLogin` to check if they're already signed in to the app and sign them in silently if they are.\n\nIf it succeeds you will get the same object as the `login` function gets,\nbut if it fails it will not show the authentication dialog to the user.\n\nCalling `trySilentLogin` is done the same as `login`, except for the function name.\n```javascript\nwindow.plugins.googleplus.trySilentLogin(\n    {\n      'scopes': '... ', // optional - space-separated list of scopes, If not included or empty, defaults to `profile` and `email`.\n      'webClientId': 'client id of the web app/server side', // optional - clientId of your Web application from Credentials settings of your project - On Android, this MUST be included to get an idToken. On iOS, it is not required.\n      'offline': true, // Optional, but requires the webClientId - if set to true the plugin will also return a serverAuthCode, which can be used to grant offline access to a non-Google server\n    },\n    function (obj) {\n      alert(JSON.stringify(obj)); // do something useful instead of alerting\n    },\n    function (msg) {\n      alert('error: ' + msg);\n    }\n);\n```\n\nIt is strongly recommended that trySilentLogin is implemented with the same options as login, to avoid any potential complications.\n\n### logout\nThis will clear the OAuth2 token.\n``` javascript\nwindow.plugins.googleplus.logout(\n    function (msg) {\n      alert(msg); // do something useful instead of alerting\n    }\n);\n```\n\n### disconnect\nThis will clear the OAuth2 token, forget which account was used to login, and disconnect that account from the app. This will require the user to allow the app access again next time they sign in. Be aware that this effect is not always instantaneous. It can take time to completely disconnect.\n``` javascript\nwindow.plugins.googleplus.disconnect(\n    function (msg) {\n      alert(msg); // do something useful instead of alerting\n    }\n);\n```\n\n## 7. Exchanging the `idToken`\n\nGoogle Documentation for Authenticating with a Backend Server\n- [Web](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/backend-auth)\n- [Android](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/backend-auth)\n- [iOS](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/backend-auth)\n\nAs the above articles mention, the `idToken` can be exchanged for user information to confirm the users identity.\n\n_Note: Google does not want user identity data sent directly to a server. The idToken is their preferred method to send that data securely and safely, as it must be verified through their servers in order to unpack._\n\nThis has several uses. On the client-side, it can be a way to get doubly confirm the user identity, or it can be used to get details such as the email host domain. The server-side is where the `idToken` really hits its stride. It is an easy way to confirm the users identity before allowing them access to that servers resources or before exchaning the `serverAuthCode` for an access and refresh token (see the next section).\n\nIf your server-side only needs identity, and not additional account access, this is a secure and simple way to supply that information.\n\n## 8. Exchanging the `serverAuthCode`\n\nGoogle Documentation for Enabling Server-Side Access\n- [Web](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2WebServer#handlingresponse)\n- [Android](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/offline-access)\n- [iOS](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/offline-access)\n\nAs the above articles mention, the `serverAuthCode` is an item that can be exchanged for an access and refresh token. Unlike the `idToken`, this allows the server-side to have direct access to the users Google account.\n\nYou have a couple options when it comes to this exchange: you can use the Google REST Apis to get those in the hybrid app itself or you can send the code to your backend server to be exchanged there, using whatever method necessary (Google provides examples for Java, Python, and JS/HTTP).\n\nAs stated before, this plugin is all about user authentication and identity, so any use of the user's account beyond that needs to be implemented per use case, per application.\n\n## 9. Troubleshooting\n- Q: I can't get authentication to work on Android. And why is there no ANDROID API KEY?\n- A: On Android you need to execute the `keytool` steps, see the installation instructions for details.\n\n- Q: OMG $@#*! the Android build is failing\n- A: You need to have _Android Support Repository_ and _Android Support Library_ installed in the Android SDK manager. Make sure you're using a fairly up to date version of those.\n\n- Q: Why isn't this working on my Android Emulator???\n- A: Make sure you are using a Virtual Device running with a **Google APIs target and/or a Google APIs CPU**!\n\n## 10. Changelog\n- 5.0.3: Added the convenience method `getSigningCertificateFingerprint` to retrieve the Android cert fingerprint which is required in the Google Developer Console.\n- 5.0.2: Require linking against `SafariServices` and `CoreText` frameworks on iOS as per Google's recommendation. Added `loginHint` on iOS.\n- 5.0.0: Android GoogleSignIn SDK (See #193), iOS SDK 4.0.0, iOS compatibility with Facebook authentication plugins, added `familyName` and `givenName`.\n- 4.0.8: Fix for Android 6 where it would crash while asking for permission.

It provides classes for easily building\nWebSocket servers and clients in Node. It does not provide a server itself, but\nrather makes it easy to handle WebSocket connections within an existing\n[Node](http://nodejs.org/) application. It does not provide any abstraction\nother than the standard [WebSocket API](http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/).\n\nIt also provides an abstraction for handling\n[EventSource](http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/) connections, which are\none-way connections that allow the server to push data to the client. They are\nbased on streaming HTTP responses and can be easier to access via proxies than\nWebSockets.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n$ npm install faye-websocket\n```\n\n\n## Handling WebSocket connections in Node\n\nYou can handle WebSockets on the server side by listening for HTTP Upgrade\nrequests, and creating a new socket for the request. This socket object exposes\nthe usual WebSocket methods for receiving and sending messages. For example this\nis how you'd implement an echo server:\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),\n    http      = require('http');\n\nvar server = http.createServer();\n\nserver.on('upgrade', function(request, socket, body) {\n  if (WebSocket.isWebSocket(request)) {\n    var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body);\n    \n    ws.on('message', function(event) {\n      ws.send(event.data);\n    });\n    \n    ws.on('close', function(event) {\n      console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);\n      ws = null;\n    });\n  }\n});\n\nserver.listen(8000);\n```\n\n`WebSocket` objects are also duplex streams, so you could replace the\n`ws.on('message', ...)` line with:\n\n```js\n    ws.pipe(ws);\n```\n\nNote that under certain circumstances (notably a draft-76 client connecting\nthrough an HTTP proxy), the WebSocket handshake will not be complete after you\ncall `new WebSocket()` because the server will not have received the entire\nhandshake from the client yet. In this case, calls to `ws.send()` will buffer\nthe message in memory until the handshake is complete, at which point any\nbuffered messages will be sent to the client.\n\nIf you need to detect when the WebSocket handshake is complete, you can use the\n`onopen` event.\n\nIf the connection's protocol version supports it, you can call `ws.ping()` to\nsend a ping message and wait for the client's response. This method takes a\nmessage string, and an optional callback that fires when a matching pong message\nis received. It returns `true` iff a ping message was sent. If the client does\nnot support ping/pong, this method sends no data and returns `false`.\n\n```js\nws.ping('Mic check, one, two', function() {\n  // fires when pong is received\n});\n```\n\n\n## Using the WebSocket client\n\nThe client supports both the plain-text `ws` protocol and the encrypted `wss`\nprotocol, and has exactly the same interface as a socket you would use in a web\nbrowser. On the wire it identifies itself as `hybi-13`.\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),\n    ws        = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/');\n\nws.on('open', function(event) {\n  console.log('open');\n  ws.send('Hello, world!');\n});\n\nws.on('message', function(event) {\n  console.log('message', event.data);\n});\n\nws.on('close', function(event) {\n  console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);\n  ws = null;\n});\n```\n\nThe WebSocket client also lets you inspect the status and headers of the\nhandshake response via its `statusCode` and `headers` properties.\n\nTo connect via a proxy, set the `proxy` option to the HTTP origin of the proxy,\nincluding any authorization information, custom headers and TLS config you\nrequire. Only the `origin` setting is required.\n\n```js\nvar ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', null, {\n  proxy: {\n    origin:  'http://username:password@proxy.example.com',\n    headers: {'User-Agent': 'node'},\n    tls:     {cert: fs.readFileSync('client.crt')}\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThe `tls` value is a Node 'TLS options' object that will be passed to\n[`tls.connect()`](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback).\n\n\n## Subprotocol negotiation\n\nThe WebSocket protocol allows peers to select and identify the application\nprotocol to use over the connection. On the client side, you can set which\nprotocols the client accepts by passing a list of protocol names when you\nconstruct the socket:\n\n```js\nvar ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', ['irc', 'amqp']);\n```\n\nOn the server side, you can likewise pass in the list of protocols the server\nsupports after the other constructor arguments:\n\n```js\nvar ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, ['irc', 'amqp']);\n```\n\nIf the client and server agree on a protocol, both the client- and server-side\nsocket objects expose the selected protocol through the `ws.protocol` property.\n\n\n## Protocol extensions\n\nfaye-websocket is based on the\n[websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)\nframework that allows extensions to be negotiated via the\n`Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header. To add extensions to a connection, pass an\narray of extensions to the `:extensions` option. For example, to add\n[permessage-deflate](https://github.com/faye/permessage-deflate-node):\n\n```js\nvar deflate = require('permessage-deflate');\n\nvar ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, null, {extensions: [deflate]});\n```\n\n\n## Initialization options\n\nBoth the server- and client-side classes allow an options object to be passed in\nat initialization time, for example:\n\n```js\nvar ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, protocols, options);\nvar ws = new WebSocket.Client(url, protocols, options);\n```\n\n`protocols` is an array of subprotocols as described above, or `null`.\n`options` is an optional object containing any of these fields:\n\n* `extensions` - an array of\n  [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)\n  compatible extensions, as described above\n* `headers` - an object containing key-value pairs representing HTTP headers to\n  be sent during the handshake process\n* `maxLength` - the maximum allowed size of incoming message frames, in bytes.\n  The default value is `2^26 - 1`, or 1 byte short of 64 MiB.\n* `ping` - an integer that sets how often the WebSocket should send ping frames,\n  measured in seconds\n\nThe client accepts some additional options:\n\n* `proxy` - settings for a proxy as described above\n* `tls` - a Node 'TLS options' object containing TLS settings for the origin\n  server, this will be passed to\n  [`tls.connect()`](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback)\n* `ca` - (legacy) a shorthand for passing `{tls: {ca: value}}`\n\n\n## WebSocket API\n\nBoth server- and client-side `WebSocket` objects support the following API.\n\n* <b>`on('open', function(event) {})`</b> fires when the socket connection is\n  established. Event has no attributes.\n* <b>`on('message', function(event) {})`</b> fires when the socket receives a\n  message. Event has one attribute, <b>`data`</b>, which is either a `String`\n  (for text frames) or a `Buffer` (for binary frames).\n* <b>`on('error', function(event) {})`</b> fires when there is a protocol error\n  due to bad data sent by the other peer. This event is purely informational,\n  you do not need to implement error recover.\n* <b>`on('close', function(event) {})`</b> fires when either the client or the\n  server closes the connection. Event has two optional attributes, <b>`code`</b>\n  and <b>`reason`</b>, that expose the status code and message sent by the peer\n  that closed the connection.\n* <b>`send(message)`</b> accepts either a `String` or a `Buffer` and sends a\n  text or binary message over the connection to the other peer.\n* <b>`ping(message = '', function() {})`</b> sends a ping frame with an optional\n  message and fires the callback when a matching pong is received.\n* <b>`close(code, reason)`</b> closes the connection, sending the given status\n  code and reason text, both of which are optional.\n* <b>`version`</b> is a string containing the version of the `WebSocket`\n  protocol the connection is using.\n* <b>`protocol`</b> is a string (which may be empty) identifying the subprotocol\n  the socket is using.\n\n\n## Handling EventSource connections in Node\n\nEventSource connections provide a very similar interface, although because they\nonly allow the server to send data to the client, there is no `onmessage` API.\nEventSource allows the server to push text messages to the client, where each\nmessage has an optional event-type and ID.\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket   = require('faye-websocket'),\n    EventSource = WebSocket.EventSource,\n    http        = require('http');\n\nvar server = http.createServer();\n\nserver.on('request', function(request, response) {\n  if (EventSource.isEventSource(request)) {\n    var es = new EventSource(request, response);\n    console.log('open', es.url, es.lastEventId);\n    \n    // Periodically send messages\n    var loop = setInterval(function() { es.send('Hello') }, 1000);\n    \n    es.on('close', function() {\n      clearInterval(loop);\n      es = null;\n    });\n  \n  } else {\n    // Normal HTTP request\n    response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});\n    response.end('Hello');\n  }\n});\n\nserver.listen(8000);\n```\n\nThe `send` method takes two optional parameters, `event` and `id`. The default\nevent-type is `'message'` with no ID. For example, to send a `notification`\nevent with ID `99`:\n\n```js\nes.send('Breaking News!', {event: 'notification', id: '99'});\n```\n\nThe `EventSource` object exposes the following properties:\n\n* <b>`url`</b> is a string containing the URL the client used to create the\n  EventSource.\n* <b>`lastEventId`</b> is a string containing the last event ID received by the\n  client. You can use this when the client reconnects after a dropped connection\n  to determine which messages need resending.\n\nWhen you initialize an EventSource with ` new EventSource()`, you can pass\nconfiguration options after the `response` parameter. Available options are:\n\n* <b>`headers`</b> is an object containing custom headers to be set on the\n  EventSource response.\n* <b>`retry`</b> is a number that tells the client how long (in seconds) it\n  should wait after a dropped connection before attempting to reconnect.\n* <b>`ping`</b> is a number that tells the server how often (in seconds) to send\n  'ping' packets to the client to keep the connection open, to defeat timeouts\n  set by proxies. The client will ignore these messages.\n\nFor example, this creates a connection that allows access from any origin, pings\nevery 15 seconds and is retryable every 10 seconds if the connection is broken:\n\n```js\nvar es = new EventSource(request, response, {\n  headers: {'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'},\n  ping:    15,\n  retry:   10\n});\n```\n\nYou can send a ping message at any time by calling `es.ping()`. Unlike\nWebSocket, the client does not send a response to this; it is merely to send\nsome data over the wire to keep the connection alive.\n\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2010-2015 James Coglan\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The Javascript sources are meant to be used by a bundler such as Webpack, SystemJS Builder, or Browserify. The type definitions provide support to Typescript tooling for things like type checking and code completion.\n\nUsually, the only import required by the user is `ionic-angular`, as everything from Ionic is exported by the package:\n\n```\n  import { App, NavController } from 'ionic-angular';\n```\n\n### Bundles\n\nMinified and unminified CommonJS and System.register module format bundles, as well as compiled CSS stylesheets for both Ionic iOS and Material Design are located `bundles/`. The SystemJS bundle is  primarily meant to be included in a `<script>` tag for demos, tests and Javascript playgrounds like [Plunker](http://plnkr.co/).\n\n### Installation and More\n\nTo use Ionic, we recommend installing and utilizing the [Ionic CLI](http://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/installation/) which will help you create pre-configured Ionic apps.\n\nFor full instructions on using Ionic, please visit the [Ionic Documentation](http://ionicframework.com/docs/)"

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

They are typically used for configuration and internationalization in Java applications as well as in Actionscript projects.  Here's an example of the format:\n\n\t# You are reading the \".properties\" entry.\n\t! The exclamation mark can also mark text as comments.\n\twebsite = http://en.wikipedia.org/\n\tlanguage = English\n\t# The backslash below tells the application to continue reading\n\t# the value onto the next line.\n\tmessage = Welcome to \\\n\t          Wikipedia!\n\t# Add spaces to the key\n\tkey\\ with\\ spaces = This is the value that could be looked up with the key \"key with spaces\".\n\t# Unicode\n\ttab : \\u0009\n*(taken from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties#Format))*\n\nCurrently works with any version of node.js.\n\n## The API\n\n- `parse(text)`: Parses `text` into key-value pairs.  Returns an object containing the key-value pairs.\n- `read(path[, callback])`: Opens the file specified by `path` and calls `parse` on its content.  If the optional `callback` parameter is provided, the result is then passed to it as the second parameter.  If an error occurs, the error object is passed to `callback` as the first parameter. If `callback` is not provided, the file specified by `path` is synchronously read and calls `parse` on its contents.  The resulting object is immediately returned.\n- `createEditor([path[, callback]])`:  If neither `path` or `callback` are provided an empty editor object is returned synchronously.  If only `path` is provided, the file specified by `path` is synchronously read and parsed.  An editor object with the results in then immediately returned.  If both `path` and `callback` are provided, the file specified by `path` is read and parsed asynchronously.  An editor object with the results are then passed to `callback` as the second parameters.  If an error occurs, the error object is passed to `callback` as the first parameter.\n- `Editor`: The editor object is returned by `createEditor`.  Has the following API:\n\t- `get(key)`: Returns the value currently associated with `key`.\n\t- `set(key, [value[, comment]])`: Associates `key` with `value`. An optional comment can be provided. If `value` is not specified or is `null`, then `key` is unset.\n\t- `unset(key)`: Unsets the specified `key`.\n\t- `save([path][, callback]])`: Writes the current contents of this editor object to a file specified by `path`.  If `path` is not provided, then it'll be defaulted to the `path` value passed to `createEditor`.  The `callback` parameter is called when the file has been written to disk.\n\t- `addHeadComment`: Added a comment to the head of the file.\n\t- `toString`: Returns the string representation of this properties editor object.  This string will be written to a file if `save` is called.\n\n## Getting node-properties-parser\n\nThe easiest way to get node-properties-parser is with [npm](http://npmjs.org/):\n\n\tnpm install properties-parser\n\nAlternatively you can clone this git repository:\n\n\tgit://github.com/xavi-/node-properties-parser.git\n\n## Developed by\n* Xavi Ramirez\n\n## License\nThis project is released under [The MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)."

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright 2015 Google Inc.\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."

    "licenseText": "# Node Stream Buffers `v0.2.5`\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/samcday/node-stream-buffer.png)](https://travis-ci.org/samcday/node-stream-buffer)\n\n... For lack of a cooler (or less confusing) name.\n\nSimple Readable and Writable Streams that use a Buffer to store received data, or for data to send out. Pretty much to be used for automated test-cases or debugging.\n\n## Installation\n\nIt's on NPM.\n\n\tnpm install stream-buffers\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use the stream buffers in your module, simply import it and away you go.\n\n\tvar streamBuffers = require(\"stream-buffers\");\n\n### Writable StreamBuffer\n\nWritable Stream Buffers implement the standardized writable stream interface. All write()'s to this object will accumulate in an internal Buffer. If the Buffer overflows it will be resized larger automatically. The initial size of the Buffer and the amount in which it grows can be configured in the constructor.\n\n\tvar myWritableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.WritableStreamBuffer({\n\t\tinitialSize: (100 * 1024),\t\t// start as 100 kilobytes.\n\t\tincrementAmount: (10 * 1024)\t// grow by 10 kilobytes each time buffer overflows.\n\t});\n\t\nThe default initial size and increment amount are stored in the following constants:\n\n\tstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_INITIAL_SIZE \t\t// (8 * 1024)\n\tstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_INCREMENT_AMOUNT\t// (8 * 1024)\n\nWriting is standard Stream stuff:\n\n\tmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(myBuffer);\n\t// - or -\n\tmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"\\u00bd + \\u00bc = \\u00be\", \"utf8\");\n\nYou can query the size of the data being held in the Buffer, and also how big the Buffer's max capacity currently is: \n\n\tmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"ASDF\");\n\tstreamBuffers.size();\t\t\t// 4.\n\tstreamBuffers.maxSize();\t\t// Whatever was configured as initial size. In our example: (100 * 1024).\n\nRetrieving the contents of the Buffer is simple:\n\n\tmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();\t\t\t\t\t// Gets all held data as a Buffer.\n\tmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString(\"utf8\");\t\t// Gets all held data as a utf8 string.\n\tmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents(5);\t\t\t\t\t// Gets first 5 bytes as a Buffer.\n\tmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString(\"utf8\", 5);\t// Gets first 5 bytes as a utf8 string.\n\nCare should be taken when getting encoded strings from WritableStream, as it doesn't really care about the contents (multi-byte characters will not be respected).\n \nDestroying or ending the WritableStream will not delete the contents of Buffer, but will disallow any further writes:\n\n\tmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"ASDF\");\n\tmyWritableStreamBuffer.destroy();\n\t\n\tmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();\t\t// Returns ASDF in Buffer.\n\tmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"Yeah?\");\t\t// No effect.\n\t\n\n### Readable StreamBuffer\n\nReadable Stream Buffers can have data inserted in them, which will then be pumped out via standard readable stream data events. The data to be sent out is held in a Buffer, which can grow in much the same way as a WritableStream Buffer does, if data is being put in Buffer faster than it's being pumped out. \n\nThe frequency in which chunks are pumped out, and the size of the chunks themselves can be configured in the constructor. The initial size and increment amount of internal Buffer can be configured too.\n\n\tvar myReadableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.ReadableStreamBuffer({\n\t\tfrequency: 10\t\t// in milliseconds.\n\t\tchunkSize: 2048\t\t// in bytes.\n\t});\n\nDefault frequency and chunk size:\n\n\tstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE \t\t// (1024)\n\tstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_FREQUENCY\t\t\t// (1)\n\nPutting data in Buffer to be pumped out is easy:\n\n\tmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(aBuffer);\n\tmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(\"A String\", \"utf8\");\n\nChunks are pumped out via standard readable stream spec: \n\n\tmyReadableStreamBuffer.on(\"data\", function(data) {\n\t\t// Yup.\n\t\tassert.isTrue(data instanceof Buffer);\n\t});\n\nChunks are pumped out by the interval that you specified in frequency. Setting the frequency to 0 will immediately stream the data (also in chunks). This is useful for unit testing.\n\nsetEncoding() for streams is respected too:\n\n\tmyReadableStreamBuffer.setEncoding(\"utf8\");\n\tmyReadableStreamBuffer.on(\"data\", function(data) {\n\t\tassert.isTrue(data instanceof String);\n\t});\n\t\nPause and resume are also implemented. pause()'ing stream will allow buffer to continue accumulating, but will not pump any of that data out until it is resume()'d again. \n\nDestroying the stream will immediately purge the buffer, unless destroySoon() is called, in which case the rest of the buffer will be written out. Either way, any further attempts to put data in the Buffer will be silently ignored. \n\n\tmyReadableStreamBuffer.destroySoon();\n\tmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(\"A String!\");\n\tmyReadableStreamBuffer.size();\t\t\t// will be 0.\n\t\n## Disclaimer\n\nNot supposed to be a speed demon, it's more for tests/debugging or weird edge cases. It works with an internal buffer that it copies contents to/from/around.\n\n## License\n\nnode-stream-buffer is free and unencumbered public domain software.

It aims to simplify things by decoupling the\nprotocol details from the I/O layer, such that users only need to implement code\nto stream data in and out of it without needing to know anything about how the\nprotocol actually works. Think of it as a complete WebSocket system with\npluggable I/O.\n\nDue to this design, you get a lot of things for free. In particular, if you hook\nthis module up to some I/O object, it will do all of this for you:\n\n* Select the correct server-side driver to talk to the client\n* Generate and send both server- and client-side handshakes\n* Recognize when the handshake phase completes and the WS protocol begins\n* Negotiate subprotocol selection based on `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`\n* Negotiate and use extensions via the\n  [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)\n  module\n* Buffer sent messages until the handshake process is finished\n* Deal with proxies that defer delivery of the draft-76 handshake body\n* Notify you when the socket is open and closed and when messages arrive\n* Recombine fragmented messages\n* Dispatch text, binary, ping, pong and close frames\n* Manage the socket-closing handshake process\n* Automatically reply to ping frames with a matching pong\n* Apply masking to messages sent by the client\n\nThis library was originally extracted from the [Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com)\nproject but now aims to provide simple WebSocket support for any Node-based\nproject.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n$ npm install websocket-driver\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\nThis module provides protocol drivers that have the same interface on the server\nand on the client. A WebSocket driver is an object with two duplex streams\nattached; one for incoming/outgoing messages and one for managing the wire\nprotocol over an I/O stream. The full API is described below.\n\n\n### Server-side with HTTP\n\nA Node webserver emits a special event for 'upgrade' requests, and this is where\nyou should handle WebSockets. You first check whether the request is a\nWebSocket, and if so you can create a driver and attach the request's I/O stream\nto it.\n\n```js\nvar http = require('http'),\n    websocket = require('websocket-driver');\n\nvar server = http.createServer();\n\nserver.on('upgrade', function(request, socket, body) {\n  if (!websocket.isWebSocket(request)) return;\n\n  var driver = websocket.http(request);\n\n  driver.io.write(body);\n  socket.pipe(driver.io).pipe(socket);\n\n  driver.messages.on('data', function(message) {\n    console.log('Got a message', message);\n  });\n\n  driver.start();\n});\n```\n\nNote the line `driver.io.write(body)` - you must pass the `body` buffer to the\nsocket driver in order to make certain versions of the protocol work.\n\n\n### Server-side with TCP\n\nYou can also handle WebSocket connections in a bare TCP server, if you're not\nusing an HTTP server and don't want to implement HTTP parsing yourself.\n\nThe driver will emit a `connect` event when a request is received, and at this\npoint you can detect whether it's a WebSocket and handle it as such. Here's an\nexample using the Node `net` module:\n\n```js\nvar net = require('net'),\n    websocket = require('websocket-driver');\n\nvar server = net.createServer(function(connection) {\n  var driver = websocket.server();\n\n  driver.on('connect', function() {\n    if (websocket.isWebSocket(driver)) {\n      driver.start();\n    } else {\n      // handle other HTTP requests\n    }\n  });\n\n  driver.on('close', function() { connection.end() });\n  connection.on('error', function() {});\n\n  connection.pipe(driver.io).pipe(connection);\n\n  driver.messages.pipe(driver.messages);\n});\n\nserver.listen(4180);\n```\n\nIn the `connect` event, the driver gains several properties to describe the\nrequest, similar to a Node request object, such as `method`, `url` and\n`headers`. However you should remember it's not a real request object; you\ncannot write data to it, it only tells you what request data we parsed from the\ninput.\n\nIf the request has a body, it will be in the `driver.body` buffer, but only as\nmuch of the body as has been piped into the driver when the `connect` event\nfires.\n\n\n### Client-side\n\nSimilarly, to implement a WebSocket client you just need to make a driver by\npassing in a URL. After this you use the driver API as described below to\nprocess incoming data and send outgoing data.\n\n\n```js\nvar net = require('net'),\n    websocket = require('websocket-driver');\n\nvar driver = websocket.client('ws://www.example.com/socket'),\n    tcp = net.connect(80, 'www.example.com');\n\ntcp.pipe(driver.io).pipe(tcp);\n\ntcp.on('connect', function() {\n  driver.start();\n});\n\ndriver.messages.on('data', function(message) {\n  console.log('Got a message', message);\n});\n```\n\nClient drivers have two additional properties for reading the HTTP data that was\nsent back by the server:\n\n* `driver.statusCode` - the integer value of the HTTP status code\n* `driver.headers` - an object containing the response headers\n\n\n### HTTP Proxies\n\nThe client driver supports connections via HTTP proxies using the `CONNECT`\nmethod. Instead of sending the WebSocket handshake immediately, it will send a\n`CONNECT` request, wait for a `200` response, and then proceed as normal.\n\nTo use this feature, call `driver.proxy(url)` where `url` is the origin of the\nproxy, including a username and password if required. This produces a duplex\nstream that you should pipe in and out of your TCP connection to the proxy\nserver. When the proxy emits `connect`, you can then pipe `driver.io` to your\nTCP stream and call `driver.start()`.\n\n```js\nvar net = require('net'),\n    websocket = require('websocket-driver');\n\nvar driver = websocket.client('ws://www.example.com/socket'),\n    proxy  = driver.proxy('http://username:password@proxy.example.com'),\n    tcp    = net.connect(80, 'proxy.example.com');\n\ntcp.pipe(proxy).pipe(tcp, {end: false});\n\ntcp.on('connect', function() {\n  proxy.start();\n});\n\nproxy.on('connect', function() {\n  driver.io.pipe(tcp).pipe(driver.io);\n  driver.start();\n});\n\ndriver.messages.on('data', function(message) {\n  console.log('Got a message', message);\n});\n```\n\nThe proxy's `connect` event is also where you should perform a TLS handshake on\nyour TCP stream, if you are connecting to a `wss:` endpoint.\n\nIn the event that proxy connection fails, `proxy` will emit an `error`. You can\ninspect the proxy's response via `proxy.statusCode` and `proxy.headers`.\n\n```js\nproxy.on('error', function(error) {\n  console.error(error.message);\n  console.log(proxy.statusCode);\n  console.log(proxy.headers);\n});\n```\n\nBefore calling `proxy.start()` you can set custom headers using\n`proxy.setHeader()`:\n\n```js\nproxy.setHeader('User-Agent', 'node');\nproxy.start();\n```\n\n\n### Driver API\n\nDrivers are created using one of the following methods:\n\n```js\ndriver = websocket.http(request, options)\ndriver = websocket.server(options)\ndriver = websocket.client(url, options)\n```\n\nThe `http` method returns a driver chosen using the headers from a Node HTTP\nrequest object. The `server` method returns a driver that will parse an HTTP\nrequest and then decide which driver to use for it using the `http` method. The\n`client` method always returns a driver for the RFC version of the protocol with\nmasking enabled on outgoing frames.\n\nThe `options` argument is optional, and is an object. It may contain the\nfollowing fields:\n\n* `maxLength` - the maximum allowed size of incoming message frames, in bytes.\n  The default value is `2^26 - 1`, or 1 byte short of 64 MiB.\n* `protocols` - an array of strings representing acceptable subprotocols for use\n  over the socket. The driver will negotiate one of these to use via the\n  `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header if supported by the other peer.\n\nA driver has two duplex streams attached to it:\n\n* <b>`driver.io`</b> - this stream should be attached to an I/O socket like a\n  TCP stream. Pipe incoming TCP chunks to this stream for them to be parsed, and\n  pipe this stream back into TCP to send outgoing frames.\n* <b>`driver.messages`</b> - this stream emits messages received over the\n  WebSocket.  Writing to it sends messages to the other peer by emitting frames\n  via the `driver.io` stream.\n\nAll drivers respond to the following API methods, but some of them are no-ops\ndepending on whether the client supports the behaviour.\n\nNote that most of these methods are commands: if they produce data that should\nbe sent over the socket, they will give this to you by emitting `data` events on\nthe `driver.io` stream.\n\n#### `driver.on('open', function(event) {})`\n\nAdds a callback to execute when the socket becomes open.\n\n#### `driver.on('message', function(event) {})`\n\nAdds a callback to execute when a message is received. `event` will have a\n`data` attribute containing either a string in the case of a text message or a\n`Buffer` in the case of a binary message.\n\nYou can also listen for messages using the `driver.messages.on('data')` event,\nwhich emits strings for text messages and buffers for binary messages.\n\n#### `driver.on('error', function(event) {})`\n\nAdds a callback to execute when a protocol error occurs due to the other peer\nsending an invalid byte sequence. `event` will have a `message` attribute\ndescribing the error.\n\n#### `driver.on('close', function(event) {})`\n\nAdds a callback to execute when the socket becomes closed. The `event` object\nhas `code` and `reason` attributes.\n\n#### `driver.addExtension(extension)`\n\nRegisters a protocol extension whose operation will be negotiated via the\n`Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header. `extension` is any extension compatible with\nthe [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)\nframework.\n\n#### `driver.setHeader(name, value)`\n\nSets a custom header to be sent as part of the handshake response, either from\nthe server or from the client. Must be called before `start()`, since this is\nwhen the headers are serialized and sent.\n\n#### `driver.start()`\n\nInitiates the protocol by sending the handshake - either the response for a\nserver-side driver or the request for a client-side one. This should be the\nfirst method you invoke.  Returns `true` if and only if a handshake was sent.\n\n#### `driver.parse(string)`\n\nTakes a string and parses it, potentially resulting in message events being\nemitted (see `on('message')` above) or in data being sent to `driver.io`.  You\nshould send all data you receive via I/O to this method by piping a stream into\n`driver.io`.\n\n#### `driver.text(string)`\n\nSends a text message over the socket. If the socket handshake is not yet\ncomplete, the message will be queued until it is. Returns `true` if the message\nwas sent or queued, and `false` if the socket can no longer send messages.\n\nThis method is equivalent to `driver.messages.write(string)`.\n\n#### `driver.binary(buffer)`\n\nTakes a `Buffer` and sends it as a binary message. Will queue and return `true`\nor `false` the same way as the `text` method. It will also return `false` if the\ndriver does not support binary messages.\n\nThis method is equivalent to `driver.messages.write(buffer)`.\n\n#### `driver.ping(string = '', function() {})`\n\nSends a ping frame over the socket, queueing it if necessary. `string` and the\ncallback are both optional. If a callback is given, it will be invoked when the\nsocket receives a pong frame whose content matches `string`. Returns `false` if\nframes can no longer be sent, or if the driver does not support ping/pong.\n\n#### `driver.pong(string = '')`\n\nSends a pong frame over the socket, queueing it if necessary. `string` is\noptional. Returns `false` if frames can no longer be sent, or if the driver does\nnot support ping/pong.\n\nYou don't need to call this when a ping frame is received; pings are replied to\nautomatically by the driver. This method is for sending unsolicited pongs.\n\n#### `driver.close()`\n\nInitiates the closing handshake if the socket is still open. For drivers with no\nclosing handshake, this will result in the immediate execution of the\n`on('close')` driver. For drivers with a closing handshake, this sends a closing\nframe and `emit('close')` will execute when a response is received or a protocol\nerror occurs.\n\n#### `driver.version`\n\nReturns the WebSocket version in use as a string. Will either be `hixie-75`,\n`hixie-76` or `hybi-$version`.\n\n#### `driver.protocol`\n\nReturns a string containing the selected subprotocol, if any was agreed upon\nusing the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` mechanism. This value becomes available after\n`emit('open')` has fired.\n\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2010-2016 James Coglan\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This library aims to allow a\nWebSocket extension to be written and used with any protocol library, by\ndefining abstract representations of frames and messages that allow modules to\nco-operate.\n\n`websocket-extensions` provides a container for registering extension plugins,\nand provides all the functions required to negotiate which extensions to use\nduring a session via the `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header. By implementing the\nAPIs defined in this document, an extension may be used by any WebSocket library\nbased on this framework.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n$ npm install websocket-extensions\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThere are two main audiences for this library: authors implementing the\nWebSocket protocol, and authors implementing extensions. End users of a\nWebSocket library or an extension should be able to use any extension by passing\nit as an argument to their chosen protocol library, without needing to know how\neither of them work, or how the `websocket-extensions` framework operates.\n\nThe library is designed with the aim that any protocol implementation and any\nextension can be used together, so long as they support the same abstract\nrepresentation of frames and messages.\n\n### Data types\n\nThe APIs provided by the framework rely on two data types; extensions will\nexpect to be given data and to be able to return data in these formats:\n\n#### *Frame*\n\n*Frame* is a structure representing a single WebSocket frame of any type. Frames\nare simple objects that must have at least the following properties, which\nrepresent the data encoded in the frame:\n\n| property     | description                                                        |\n| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `final`      | `true` if the `FIN` bit is set, `false` otherwise                  |\n| `rsv1`       | `true` if the `RSV1` bit is set, `false` otherwise                 |\n| `rsv2`       | `true` if the `RSV2` bit is set, `false` otherwise                 |\n| `rsv3`       | `true` if the `RSV3` bit is set, `false` otherwise                 |\n| `opcode`     | the numeric opcode (`0`, `1`, `2`, `8`, `9`, or `10`) of the frame |\n| `masked`     | `true` if the `MASK` bit is set, `false` otherwise                 |\n| `maskingKey` | a 4-byte `Buffer` if `masked` is `true`, otherwise `null`          |\n| `payload`    | a `Buffer` containing the (unmasked) application data              |\n\n#### *Message*\n\nA *Message* represents a complete application message, which can be formed from\ntext, binary and continuation frames. It has the following properties:\n\n| property | description                                                       |\n| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `rsv1`   | `true` if the first frame of the message has the `RSV1` bit set   |\n| `rsv2`   | `true` if the first frame of the message has the `RSV2` bit set   |\n| `rsv3`   | `true` if the first frame of the message has the `RSV3` bit set   |\n| `opcode` | the numeric opcode (`1` or `2`) of the first frame of the message |\n| `data`   | the concatenation of all the frame payloads in the message        |\n\n### For driver authors\n\nA driver author is someone implementing the WebSocket protocol proper, and who\nwishes end users to be able to use WebSocket extensions with their library.\n\nAt the start of a WebSocket session, on both the client and the server side,\nthey should begin by creating an extension container and adding whichever\nextensions they want to use.\n\n```js\nvar Extensions = require('websocket-extensions'),\n    deflate    = require('permessage-deflate');\n\nvar exts = new Extensions();\nexts.add(deflate);\n```\n\nIn the following examples, `exts` refers to this `Extensions` instance.\n\n#### Client sessions\n\nClients will use the methods `generateOffer()` and `activate(header)`.\n\nAs part of the handshake process, the client must send a\n`Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header to advertise that it supports the registered\nextensions. This header should be generated using:\n\n```js\nrequest.headers['sec-websocket-extensions'] = exts.generateOffer();\n```\n\nThis returns a string, for example `\"permessage-deflate;\nclient_max_window_bits\"`, that represents all the extensions the client is\noffering to use, and their parameters. This string may contain multiple offers\nfor the same extension.\n\nWhen the client receives the handshake response from the server, it should pass\nthe incoming `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header in to `exts` to activate the\nextensions the server has accepted:\n\n```js\nexts.activate(response.headers['sec-websocket-extensions']);\n```\n\nIf the server has sent any extension responses that the client does not\nrecognize, or are in conflict with one another for use of RSV bits, or that use\ninvalid parameters for the named extensions, then `exts.activate()` will\n`throw`. In this event, the client driver should fail the connection with\nclosing code `1010`.\n\n#### Server sessions\n\nServers will use the method `generateResponse(header)`.\n\nA server session needs to generate a `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header to send\nin its handshake response:\n\n```js\nvar clientOffer = request.headers['sec-websocket-extensions'],\n    extResponse = exts.generateResponse(clientOffer);\n\nresponse.headers['sec-websocket-extensions'] = extResponse;\n```\n\nCalling `exts.generateResponse(header)` activates those extensions the client\nhas asked to use, if they are registered, asks each extension for a set of\nresponse parameters, and returns a string containing the response parameters for\nall accepted extensions.\n\n#### In both directions\n\nBoth clients and servers will use the methods `validFrameRsv(frame)`,\n`processIncomingMessage(message)` and `processOutgoingMessage(message)`.\n\nThe WebSocket protocol requires that frames do not have any of the `RSV` bits\nset unless there is an extension in use that allows otherwise. When processing\nan incoming frame, sessions should pass a *Frame* object to:\n\n```js\nexts.validFrameRsv(frame)\n```\n\nIf this method returns `false`, the session should fail the WebSocket connection\nwith closing code `1002`.\n\nTo pass incoming messages through the extension stack, a session should\nconstruct a *Message* object according to the above datatype definitions, and\ncall:\n\n```js\nexts.processIncomingMessage(message, function(error, msg) {\n  // hand the message off to the application\n});\n```\n\nIf any extensions fail to process the message, then the callback will yield an\nerror and the session should fail the WebSocket connection with closing code\n`1010`. If `error` is `null`, then `msg` should be passed on to the application.\n\nTo pass outgoing messages through the extension stack, a session should\nconstruct a *Message* as before, and call:\n\n```js\nexts.processOutgoingMessage(message, function(error, msg) {\n  // write message to the transport\n});\n```\n\nIf any extensions fail to process the message, then the callback will yield an\nerror and the session should fail the WebSocket connection with closing code\n`1010`. If `error` is `null`, then `message` should be converted into frames\n(with the message's `rsv1`, `rsv2`, `rsv3` and `opcode` set on the first frame)\nand written to the transport.\n\nAt the end of the WebSocket session (either when the protocol is explicitly\nended or the transport connection disconnects), the driver should call:\n\n```js\nexts.close(function() {})\n```\n\nThe callback is invoked when all extensions have finished processing any\nmessages in the pipeline and it's safe to close the socket.\n\n### For extension authors\n\nAn extension author is someone implementing an extension that transforms\nWebSocket messages passing between the client and server. They would like to\nimplement their extension once and have it work with any protocol library.\n\nExtension authors will not install `websocket-extensions` or call it directly.\nInstead, they should implement the following API to allow their extension to\nplug into the `websocket-extensions` framework.\n\nAn `Extension` is any object that has the following properties:\n\n| property | description                                                                  |\n| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `name`   | a string containing the name of the extension as used in negotiation headers |\n| `type`   | a string, must be `\"permessage\"`                                             |\n| `rsv1`   | either `true` if the extension uses the RSV1 bit, `false` otherwise          |\n| `rsv2`   | either `true` if the extension uses the RSV2 bit, `false` otherwise          |\n| `rsv3`   | either `true` if the extension uses the RSV3 bit, `false` otherwise          |\n\nIt must also implement the following methods:\n\n```js\next.createClientSession()\n```\n\nThis returns a *ClientSession*, whose interface is defined below.\n\n```js\next.createServerSession(offers)\n```\n\nThis takes an array of offer params and returns a *ServerSession*, whose\ninterface is defined below. For example, if the client handshake contains the\noffer header:\n\n```\nSec-WebSocket-Extensions: permessage-deflate; server_no_context_takeover; server_max_window_bits=8, \\\n                          permessage-deflate; server_max_window_bits=15\n```\n\nthen the `permessage-deflate` extension will receive the call:\n\n```js\next.createServerSession([\n  {server_no_context_takeover: true, server_max_window_bits: 8},\n  {server_max_window_bits: 15}\n]);\n```\n\nThe extension must decide which set of parameters it wants to accept, if any,\nand return a *ServerSession* if it wants to accept the parameters and `null`\notherwise.\n\n#### *ClientSession*\n\nA *ClientSession* is the type returned by `ext.createClientSession()`. It must\nimplement the following methods, as well as the *Session* API listed below.\n\n```js\nclientSession.generateOffer()\n// e.g.  -> [\n//            {server_no_context_takeover: true, server_max_window_bits: 8},\n//            {server_max_window_bits: 15}\n//          ]\n```\n\nThis must return a set of parameters to include in the client's\n`Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` offer header. If the session wants to offer multiple\nconfigurations, it can return an array of sets of parameters as shown above.\n\n```js\nclientSession.activate(params) // -> true\n```\n\nThis must take a single set of parameters from the server's handshake response\nand use them to configure the client session. If the client accepts the given\nparameters, then this method must return `true`. If it returns any other value,\nthe framework will interpret this as the client rejecting the response, and will\n`throw`.\n\n#### *ServerSession*\n\nA *ServerSession* is the type returned by `ext.createServerSession(offers)`. It\nmust implement the following methods, as well as the *Session* API listed below.\n\n```js\nserverSession.generateResponse()\n// e.g.  -> {server_max_window_bits: 8}\n```\n\nThis returns the set of parameters the server session wants to send in its\n`Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` response header. Only one set of parameters is\nreturned to the client per extension. Server sessions that would confict on\ntheir use of RSV bits are not activated.\n\n#### *Session*\n\nThe *Session* API must be implemented by both client and server sessions. It\ncontains two methods, `processIncomingMessage(message)` and\n`processOutgoingMessage(message)`.\n\n```js\nsession.processIncomingMessage(message, function(error, msg) { ... })\n```\n\nThe session must implement this method to take an incoming *Message* as defined\nabove, transform it in any way it needs, then return it via the callback. If\nthere is an error processing the message, this method should yield an error as\nthe first argument.\n\n```js\nsession.processOutgoingMessage(message, function(error, msg) { ... })\n```\n\nThe session must implement this method to take an outgoing *Message* as defined\nabove, transform it in any way it needs, then return it via the callback. If\nthere is an error processing the message, this method should yield an error as\nthe first argument.\n\nNote that both `processIncomingMessage()` and `processOutgoingMessage()` can\nperform their logic asynchronously, are allowed to process multiple messages\nconcurrently, and are not required to complete working on messages in the same\norder the messages arrive. `websocket-extensions` will reorder messages as your\nextension emits them and will make sure every extension is given messages in the\norder they arrive from the driver. This allows extensions to maintain state that\ndepends on the messages' wire order, for example keeping a DEFLATE compression\ncontext between messages.\n\n```js\nsession.close()\n```\n\nThe framework will call this method when the WebSocket session ends, allowing\nthe session to release any resources it's using.\n\n## Examples\n\n* Consumer: [websocket-driver](https://github.com/faye/websocket-driver-node)\n* Provider: [permessage-deflate](https://github.com/faye/permessage-deflate-node)\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014-2015 James Coglan\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
